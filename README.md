# CapstoneProj
Spring 2024 Computer Science Capstone Project

This project is a Godot game called "Deadwood", being developed by Veljko Kotarica, Leney Gannasan, and Kyle Storti.

About Deadwood: 
Deadwood is a game about four people camping out in the deep forest of Deadwood, which is said to be cursed by "Wild Bill Hickok". Msyterious appearances have caused people to go missing over the years, which only entices our four protagonists even more. When weird things start to happen, the group is separated and need to regroup and survive until daytime to have a chance of making it out of Deadwood.

The goal of the user is to make correct decisions for each of the four characters with the goal of keeping them all alive until morning. Picking up objects and making 50/50 split decisions will control which way the storyline goes, which will eventually lead to one of a variety of endings.

The project is programmed entirely in Godot using the engines own language (GDScript).
